## The Model Reducer

In Redux Simple Form, a **model reducer** is a reducer that responds to \`change()\` actions on the model you specify when creating the model reducer. Let's say your user model looks like this:

${js`
let initialUser = {
  firstName: '',
  lastName: ''
};
`}

You can create a model reducer that responds only to changes to models that modify the user like this:

${js`
import { createModelReducer } from 'redux-simple-form';

let initialUser = {
  firstName: '',
  lastName: ''
};

const userReducer = createModelReducer('user', initialUser);
`}

Now, when you send a \`change(...)\` action that intends to modify the user, such as \`change('user.firstName', 'John')\`, the reducer will update the model accordingly.

The \`createModelReducer(model, initialState)\` function takes two arguments: the **model** and the optional **initialState**. It's highly recommended that you provide an initial state to your model reducer, though Redux Simple Form will create missing keys (shallow or deep) regardless.

### Model Reducers in Stores

The _only requirement_\\* in Redux Simple Form is that your model reducer has the **same model as the key of the reducer in the store.** This is so that the \`<Field model="...">\` component knows where to look for the latest model value. Here is how you would set up a model reducer in your app's store:

${js`
// store.js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';
import { createModelReducer } from 'redux-simple-router';

const store = createStore(combineReducers({
  user: createModelReducer('user'),
  items: createModelReducer('items'),
  // etc.
}));

export default store;
`}

\\* If you are not using the \`<Field />\` component, you may forego this requirement.

### Updating Models

The model reducer uses the \`action.model\` path to know where which part of the state should be updated.

It uses [seamless-immutable's](todo) \`Immutable.setIn(path, value)\` and [lodash's](todo) \`_.toPath(path)\` under the hood to make these changes. For example, given this state:

${js`
const state = {
  user: {  
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Smith',
    phones: [
      { number: '5551234567', type: 'home' },
      { number: '5559876543', type: 'work' }
    ]
  }
}
`}

A value from an object key can be retrieved with the path \`'user.firstName'\` and a value inside an array can be retrieved with \`'user.phones[1]'\`, and with even more granularity, \`'user.phones[1].number'\`.

### Custom Model Reducers

Using \`createModelReducer()\` is *not required*, and you can implement your own functionality to respond to model changes:

${js`
import { actionTypes } from 'redux-simple-form';

const userReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  if (action.type === actionTypes.CHANGE) {
    if (action.model === 'user.firstName') {
      return {
        ...state,
        firstName: action.value
      }
    }
  }

  return state;
}
`}

However, \`createModelReducer()\` is _really convenient_, as it uses [lodash](http://lodash.com/docs) and [seamless-immutable](http://github.com/rfeldman/seamless-immutable) to efficiently update the model given a model string such as \`"foo.bar[2].baz"\`. The new state derived from the model reducer can be used as an intermediate state, which can then be used to make custom state updates:

${js`
import { createModelReducer } from 'redux-simple-form';

let initialState = {
  firstName: '',
  lastName: '',
  fullName: ''
};

const modelReducer = createModelReducer('user', initialState);

const fullName = (state) => {
  return {
    ...state,
    fullName: [state.firstName, state.lastName].join(' ')
  };
}

const userReducer = (state, action) => {
  let model = modelReducer(state, action);
  let newState = fullName(model);

  return newState;
}

export default userReducer;
`}
`;

const ModelReducerPage = () => (
  <Markdown content={content} />
);

export default ModelReducerPage;
